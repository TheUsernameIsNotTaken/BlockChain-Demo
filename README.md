A demo app to show basic blockchain workflow for a school project.

State: Finished Working logic.

Current development:
 - Unit-test level of work.
 - Debugged classes.
 - PoW algorithm implemented.
 - Validity and Correction check for messages, transactions and blocks.

The blockchain parts can be used to make an interactive app, but the how-it-works can already be seen from the project.

Using:
 - CryptoCC for cryptographic algorithms.
